          <p>Heading in to march now, amazing to think I&rsquo;ve already been here for over 40 days! It really has gone
            by so quickly.</p>

          <p>This morning, and indeed for most of the day, I was occupied by manual testing. I managed to get one story
            through QA but had issues with a second one as I could not test it on mobile. </p>

          <p>Aside from manual testing, I reattempted my automated tests from earlier in the week but the same issue
            exists. The tests are still failing due to the reg lookup feature being broken on ninja builds. Hopefully it
            will be back up and running on Monday so I can finally get theses tests over the line. </p>

          <p>Oh, on another note &ndash; I got my first branch and pull request opened on Github! Now my name is forever
            cemented into Distilled&rsquo;s web test repo haha!</p>

        </div>

        <div class="tab content" id="day2">
          <p>Today started with some manual testing on a story on of the devs worked on last Friday. Once I kicked off
            the build though, I noticed an issue. The added feature was adding validation to the loan application form
            &ndash; but this feature existed on the newer single platform database that Distilled are moving towards
            rather than the old DB the rest on DoneDeal is on. </p>

          <p>Because of this, scripts had to be loaded into the page to get the new features to display &ndash; this
            caused problems insofar as the feature could not be tested on devices or with ran with automation as these
            scripts could not be loaded in with devices or automated browser session. </p>

          <p>Aside from that blocker (which the devs are going to take a look into), the rest of the day was taken up by
            manual testing as well as a presentation on CICD (continuous integration continuous delivery) &ndash; which
            was very&#8230; technical to say the least. But it was still good to sit in on, and if anything, learned
            about the overall release flow in the company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab content" id="day3">
          <p>The return of the firebase project! </p>

          <p>After handing the firebase project off to the Site Reliability Engineers a few weeks back to task them with
            pushing the data to influxDB, today a meeting was scheduled between myself and someone from SRE to address
            this issue.</p>

          <p>After an hour of going through different methods to try and push data to influx from a curl command, we
            finally made some progress. The data was know writing but with the issue that the values weren&rsquo;t
            getting passed. After the meeting I tried working more on this myself. </p>

          <p>I eventually managed to get the values to pass, but it still left the question of how this writing of data
            was to be automated. This is essentially what I spent the rest of the day on. The approach I landed on was
            to use a node module to support the execution of unix commands (curl) inside the program. </p>

          <p>There is still some work to be done though as I couldn&rsquo;t get variables to be passed correctly to the
            unix command, so this will be my starting point for tomorrow it seems!</p>
