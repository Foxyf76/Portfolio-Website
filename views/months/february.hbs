          <p>This morning I kicked off with the API to try and change calendar visibility. This proved to be a little
            difficult as there was limited help online beyond the docs. A lot of the struggling came from trying to find
            individual events. But what I eventually found was that each Event ID was contained in the source HTML and
            was encoded. So once I found the code to decode it, I could find the corresponding event and begin to make
            changes. </p>

          <p>The final step was to change the event visibility, which I found a helpful page on StackOverflow to help
            with. After some trial and error I eventually managed to change the visibility – but that leaves a few
            questions. </p>

          <p>
            <li>How do I authenticate each user?</li>
            <li>How will I get this code working in a plugin when it’s all done through inline Javascript?</li>
          </p>

          <p>There is still a lot of work to be done, but at least I have the foundations in place. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="tab content" id="day2">
          <p>Today started with a little bit of messing around with the calendar project, seeing ways of incorporating
            the API code into a plugin – which I didn’t get far with as Googles rules for what is allowed in plugins is
            a lot more strict than I thought. </p>

          <p>I also had a meeting with Sean to talk about the firebase project. Sean had been talking to some of the
            guys in Dublin who were responsible for getting other analytics on grafana and instructed me to put my
            project inside a docker container. </p>

          <p>Sean said I should try make this my priority for the next few days as once this is done, the guys in Dublin
            will help from there.
          </p>

          <p>Sean gave me a repo link to a template docker environment so that’s my starting point. I will pick up on it
            first thing tomorrow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab content" id="day3">
          <p>Picking up from yesterday, this morning I went straight into working on setting up docker. </p>

          <p>The first step to this was to take out my code from the previous directory which was based of the DoneDeal
            testing repo, and move it to it&rsquo;s own directory. But I ran into problems pretty quickly after. The
            docker and Webdriver IO config files were set up quite differently than to what worked in the old directory.
            This led to problems with even getting the tests to run. </p>

          <p>After spending a few hours on it, I got a better idea of where the problem was. In this config, chrome is
            run in what is called &lsquo;headless mode&rsquo;, where the browser is never actually opened during the
            tests and it&rsquo;s all done through a server. Whatever way chrome is run on this server, it&rsquo;s
            causing my tests to fail. I will have to talk to Sean to get help fixing this. </p>

          <p>The rest of the afternoon was spent doing some manual testing for the new Bluestone Finance feature being
            added to the site, where I had to test the application form validation. </p>

          <p>I will hopefully make some more progress on docker tomorrow.</p>
